Welcome to the Flutter Minesweeper game!

## Introduction

This game was created as a codebase for a streaming episode of ["NonCompila"](https://www.twitch.tv/noncompila) to showcase Flutter's potential in the fields of gaming and user interface interaction.

## How to play

To play, first click on a square to select it. If you reveal a mine, you lose the game. Otherwise, the number of adjacent mines will be displayed. Continue selecting squares until you have revealed all free squares and won the game!

## How to use the codebase

The codebase was created with Flutter, the cross-platform application development framework. To use the codebase, you must first install Flutter and Dart on your computer ([official guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)). Once installed, you can clone the repository from the following URL: https://github.com/gallottino/minesweeper-flutter.git.

Once cloned, you can open the project in an IDE such as Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, run the "flutter pub get" command to download and install the dependencies, and finally run the "flutter run" command to start the application.

## Conclusion

Thank you for following us! We hope you enjoy playing and that it can inspire your next app development project. If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the game or the codebase, please do not hesitate to contact me at d.gallotti@outlook.it.
